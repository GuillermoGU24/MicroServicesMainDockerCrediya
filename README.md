# 🚀 Microservices Project

This repository contains a **microservices-based architecture** that includes:

- 🔐 **Authentication**: Service for user authentication and management.  
- 📱 **Application**: Main application service.  
- 🗄️ **SQL**: Database scripts and configuration.  
- 🐳 **Docker Compose**: Container orchestration to run all services together.  

The project uses **Git submodules** to keep microservices decoupled and enable independent development and deployment.
